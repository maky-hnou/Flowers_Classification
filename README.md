# Flowers_Classification  
Flower Species Classifier using TensorFlow.  


## About this repo:  
In this repo, I used TensorFlow to build VGG16 and train it from scratch using the *[102 Category Flower Dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)*, a dataset consisting of 102 flower categories.  


## Content:  

- **categories_names.json:** a json file conaining the flowers/categories names.
- **prepocessing.py:** the code used to preprocess the images.
- **run_training.py:** the code used to launch the training.
- **test.py:** the code used to test the model once it is trained.
- **train.py:** the code used train the model.
- **utils.py:** a python file containing utils functions.
- **vgg_16.py:** the coded used to build VGG16.
- **requirements.txt:** a text file containing the needed packages to run the project (if you want to use GPU instead of CPU, change tensorflow to tensorflow-gpu in requirements.txt).
